ferite major mode for emacs

The ferite-mode.el needs to be placed within a load path for emacs.

For example; create the directory ~/.emacs.d if it doesn't already
exist. Then add the following line to your ~/.emacs file:

(setq load-path (append load-path (list "~/.emacs.d")))
(require 'ferite-mode)

This should load the ferite mode automatically when you load a ferite
script file (eg, any file with an extension of .fe or .fec).
