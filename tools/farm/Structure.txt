Farm Structure
--------------

farm.fe - this is the core system.

rulesets/ - per platform specific rulesets for building code,
	  by default each platform must be able to handle:

	  'c', 'c++', 'objc', building of shared, static and 
	  loadable libraries

	  They are simply a wrapper around a set of commands that,
	  given a set of files, will process those files and return
	  the output file.

rulesets/Toplevel.fe - contains various intermediate files such
		     as 'fec', 'y', 'l' files.

tagsets/ - The core tags within the system both target and action
	 tags.
