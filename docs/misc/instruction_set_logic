if( [expr] ) 
{
  [then]
} 
else 
{
  [else]
}

evalute the expression
create a jump if the status register is 0
 setup a flag to say you need an address in the array to jump to and
 push that onto a stack
 
 <!--- process stuff in the if --->
 
find address of the else (or next set of instructions)
pop the top off the requested flag list
 and set the address at the information held within that location
 (back tracking)
push another flag onto the stack to say you want nother jump (if there is an
else)

 <!--- process else shit --->
 
end of else, jump back and add the addrss to the stack.
